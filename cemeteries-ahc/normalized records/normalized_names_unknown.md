# `normalize_names_unknown.py` Script Guide

## Introduction
This guide describes the `normalize_names_unknown.py` script, which is designed to identify and standardize unknown or empty name entries in a dataset. The script processes entries from `combined.csv` and outputs them to `normalized_names_unknown.csv`.

## Script Functions

### Libraries:
- **csv**: Handles operations on CSV files, including reading and writing data.

### File Operations:
- **Source File**: `combined.csv`
- **Output File**: `normalized_names_unknown.csv`

### Process Overview:
- The script checks for empty or 'unknown' entries in the first name and last name fields and updates the 'name_archival_and_communit' field accordingly.

### Workflow:
1. **Header Setup**:
   - Initiates the output file with headers: `['pkoakwood', 'firstname', 'lastname', 'name_archival_and_communit']`. The `pkoakwood` column functions as a primary key.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Iterates over each row to examine the first name (`row[1]`) and last name (`row[2]`).
   - Flags rows where these fields are empty or labeled 'unknown'.
   - Marks these records in the 'name_archival_and_communit' field with 'Unknown first name or last name'.
   - Writes the updated rows to the output file.

## Documentation and Files
- **Python Script**: Located in the `scripts` folder.
- **Documentation and CSV Output**: Stored together to facilitate easy reference.

This script enhances data clarity by marking incomplete or uncertain name records, ensuring consistency across the dataset.
