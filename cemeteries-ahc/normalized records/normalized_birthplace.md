# Guide to the `normalize_birthplace.py` Script

## Introduction
This document provides a detailed description of the `normalize_birthplace.py` script, which is designed to standardize the format of birthplace entries in a dataset. Located in the `scripts` folder, this script processes data from `combined.csv` and outputs it to `normalized_birthplace.csv`. The guide and the CSV file are stored together for convenient access and review.

## Script Description

### Libraries Utilized:
- **csv**: Handles reading from and writing to CSV files, ensuring accurate and reliable data manipulation.
- **re (Regular Expressions)**: Supports string operations through pattern matching, essential for text normalization tasks.

### Functionality:
- A comprehensive set of conditions is defined to correct common typos and standardize variations in the naming of places, particularly focusing on birthplace data. Each condition maps a frequently mislabeled or variably labeled location to its standardized form.

### Regular Expression Configuration:
- Regular expressions are used sparingly in this script to identify patterns within strings, facilitating the normalization process where straightforward string comparison is insufficient.

### File Operations:
- **Source File**: `combined.csv` – contains the original, unstandardized birthplace data.
- **Destination File**: `normalized_birthplace.csv` – stores the standardized birthplace data, ensuring improved clarity and consistency.

### Data Processing Workflow:
1. **Header Initialization**:
   - The output file is initiated with a clear, descriptive header: `['pkoakwood', 'nativity']`. The `pkoakwood` column serves as a primary key, a holdover artifact from the script’s previous MySQL implementation, enhancing data traceability.

2. **Data Normalization**:
   - The script iterates through each row, focusing on the eighth column assumed to contain birthplace information.
   - It applies the normalization function to each entry, replacing it with a standardized form if a known variant or typo is detected.
   - Rows with modified birthplace data are written to the output file, ensuring that only updated records are saved.

## Emphasizing USWDS Principles
This script exemplifies the USWDS's commitment to user-centered design by:
- **Addressing real user needs**: Streamlining data formats to facilitate easier data handling and analysis.
- **Building trust through transparency and consistency**: By providing comprehensive documentation alongside the script and processed data, users are equipped to understand and trust the methods applied.
- **Ensuring accessibility**: By maintaining structured and predictable output, the data becomes more accessible and usable for all stakeholders.

## Documentation and File Location
- **Python Script**: Available in the `scripts` folder.
- **Documentation and Output CSV**: Co-located to offer straightforward access to both the processed results and an explanation of the procedures involved.

By standardizing data and providing clear documentation, this script supports the principles of effective and ethical public service information management, in line with USWDS standards.

This guide has been updated to specifically include mention of `pkoakwood` as a useful artifact from the script’s MySQL version, enhancing its utility by serving as a primary key for database operations.
