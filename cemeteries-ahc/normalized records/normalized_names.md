# Guide to the Name Normalization Script

## Introduction
This document outlines the functionality of a Python script tasked with normalizing names from a CSV file. It aims to make the script's operations transparent and understandable, supporting USWDS principles of user-centered design. The script, located in the `scripts` folder, processes data from `combined.csv` and outputs it to `normalized_name.csv`, with this guide accompanying both files for easy reference.

## Script Capabilities

### Utilized Libraries:
- **csv**: Enables efficient and reliable reading from and writing to CSV files.
- **re (Regular Expressions)**: Utilizes pattern matching to refine and format textual data effectively, ensuring high clarity and usability of processed data.

### Regular Expression Configuration:
- A compiled pattern `re.compile(r'$begin:math:text$(.*?)$end:math:text$')` is used to detect and extract content within parentheses, enhancing data precision during processing.

### File Operations:
- **Source File**: `combined.csv` – the original dataset.
- **Destination File**: `normalized_name.csv` – hosts the processed output, structured for accessibility and ease of use.

### Data Processing Workflow:
1. **Header Initialization**:
   - The script defines a clear header for the output file: `['pkoakwood', 'firstname', 'name_archival_and_communit']`. `pkoakwood` is retained as a useful artifact from the MySQL version, serving as a primary key that enhances data traceability and utility.

2. **Row-by-Row Processing**:
   - Each row in the source file is scrutinized, particularly focusing on extracting and manipulating content within the second column's parentheses.
   - Processes include:
     - Isolating the `archival_name` by extracting content within parentheses and cleaning it.
     - Retaining the main part of the name as `firstname` after removing the parenthetical content, which helps in maintaining structured and navigable data.
     - Appending the `archival_name` to any existing content in the fourth column to enrich data continuity and detail.
   - The processed data is methodically written to the output file to ensure consistency and maintain data integrity.

## Commitment to User-Centered Design
By detailing every step of the data processing and providing a clear guide, this script upholds USWDS’s core principles:
- **Starting with real user needs**: Facilitates clear and usable data output, crucial for effective analysis and reporting.
- **Earning trust through transparency**: Accompanying detailed documentation allows users to understand and verify the methodologies employed.
- **Embracing accessibility**: The predictable structure of the output CSV ensures it is accessible and usable by all.

## Documentation and File Location
- **Python Script**: Stored within the `scripts` folder, readily accessible for any necessary review or modifications.
- **Documentation and Output CSV**: Stored together, providing seamless access to both the results and the detailed processing logic.

This guide exemplifies adherence to ethical and user-focused documentation standards, enhancing data quality and accessibility, and ensuring that public service information management aligns with the USWDS principles.
